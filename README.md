Welcome to Health Quotes! Here are the instructions to run our project. 

Keep in mind, this code only works with windows devices, it does not have MacOS compatibility

Your IDE to run this project must be Visual Studio Code (VSCode). We are not responsible for any errors you may get for trying to run in another IDE

Conduct a pip install for the libraries nltk, random, and scikit-learn. If you can import these without errors, no action needs to be taken regarding imports

If you get errors for importing some of the libraries (in my experience nltk was problematic for me), you must set up a virtual environment in VSCode and do the pip installs in your venv.

If you must set up a venv, ensure that your machine does not block scripts from running. If your machine DOES block scripts from running, change the execution policy to 'unrestricted' as the default is most likely 'restricted'

DO NOT RENAME ANY FILES YOU DOWNLOAD FROM OUR GITHUB REPO

You MUST download our depression.txt and it MUST be saved in your C: drive. For minimum hassle save it as a file within the C: drive and NOT WITHIN A FOLDER IN YOUR C: DRIVE
